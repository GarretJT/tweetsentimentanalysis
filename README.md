Dataset:
The dataset consists of 14,640 observations of tweets from Twitter (X), covering opinions about six different US-based airline companies. The dataset is available on Kaggle.  Dataset link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment?resource=download.

Methods: 
- Naïve Bayes 
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression.
Pre-processed data with TF-IDF vectorization. 

Results: 
Logistic Regression achieved highest accuracy at 81%, surpassing other models (Naïve Bayes - 74%, KNN - 72%, Random Forest - 77%) Link to report & Python Notebook Code here.

Conclusion: 
This study evaluated several machine learning models for sentiment analysis of tweets about US airline companies. The Logistic Regression model emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 81% in distinguishing sentiments across the dataset. This performance superiority suggests Logistic Regression's robustness in handling textual data for sentiment analysis tasks.
